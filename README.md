# Youtube-Video-Downloader
A youtube video downloader based on Nodejs.
The initial project is based strongly on the tutorial by [Codingflag](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXDLrsqe14uFu6k96xjlF4w). 
You can find the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtxv_NDQeyo&t=658s); there is not much in the way of explanation but it can serve as a good starting point for anyone that wants to get started in Node and see results fairly quickly.
